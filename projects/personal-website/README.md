# Personal Website
This folder contains the source code for my personal website, which is part of my coding portfolio. The website is a simple, clean, single‑page design built using HTML and CSS, and it will be published using GitHub Pages.
## Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Introduce who I am
- Showcase my coding projects and achievements
- Provide a professional online presence for future applications (PwC, universities, competitions)
## Files in this project
- `index.html` — main webpage
- `styles.css` — styling for the website
- `script.js` — optional JavaScript file (empty for now)
- `assets/` — images or icons used on the site
## How to view the website
Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the website will be available at:
https://slan123.github.io/arslan-portfolio/projects/personal-website/
(If the link doesn’t work yet, GitHub Pages may still be building.)
## How to edit the website
1. Open the `index.html` file
2. Make changes to the text or layout
3. Edit `styles.css` to change colours, fonts, spacing, etc.
4. Commit your changes to update the live site
## Future improvements
- Add a navigation bar  
- Add project cards with screenshots  
- Add a dark mode  
- Add animations or transitions  
- Add a contact section
